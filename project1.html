    <h1> SMART BLIND STICK</h1>

    <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
</div>
<div class="para">
    <h4>Without vision it can be challenging for a visually 
        impaired person to navigate through a room or a
        hallway without bumping into obstacles. 
        Even with aid,such as walking stick, it can be sometimes 
        inconvenient, uncomfortable,and perhaps, 
        inaccurate in avoiding obstacles.</h4></div>
        <br>
        <h2>DEFINATION OF THE PROJECT</h2>
        <P>Here,we develop a tool which can serve as a blind stick being more efficient and helpful than conventional one. 
            The smart blind stick automatically detects the obstacle in front of the person and give him a response to the 
            person by vibrating the stick and also with a warning sound. Through this, the blind person can aware about the
             obstacles in front of him. I used Ultrasonic sensor for detecting the obstacles.</P>

                IDEATE OF THE PROJECT
             </h2>
             <P>The main component is Arduino Uno .it contains everything needed to support the microcontroller 
                Ultrasonic sensor is connected with Arduino broad,it senses the material or things which is near to the user. 
                Here transmitters convert electrical signals into ultrasonic sound. 
                Buzzer helps the user and even to the people who near to the user. 
                We use these components to make a blind stick which is easy to carry
                 and helpful for the blind people.</P>
